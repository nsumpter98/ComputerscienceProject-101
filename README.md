This program will be used to collect a list of item names, item prices, and the tax 
percentages to be stored in a JSON file. This program will run in a loop to let the user put in as many items as they like. 
The item names will be stored in a list of the Item class that contains the item name and cost.
There will be a menu when the program first launches telling the user that to exit the program to type “done”.
With the ability to enter an unlimited number of items there will be no worries of running out of item inputs. 
The ability to specify the tax rate for any given state will also allow the users to use this program across the country with many varying tax percentages.
